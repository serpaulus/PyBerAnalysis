# Report - PyBer Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information regarding ride-sharing data by city type, as well as a multiple-line visualization showing the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results:
The analysis summary of the data, see below fig, shows number of that total number of rides are higher in the urban areas followed by the suburban and rural areas, as expected due to population factors.  The number of total drivers also follows expected trends in line with population; however, in urban areas there was significant higher number of drivers per the ride demand in the time period covered.  Still the urban areas have the highest fare revenue due to ride volume; however rural areas although with lower ride volume show to be the most profitable.

## Summary:
The data shoes balance trends in the Rural and Suburban areas.  This is not the case for the number of total drivers seams to be almost a third higher than the number of rides, presenting a possible imbalance that drives the average fare per driver lower which could potentially affect driver job satisfaction, as well as driver and company profits.  Recommend further analysis incorporating driver job status e.g., part time vs fulltime, company overhead cost per driver, and a driver satisfaction survey.
